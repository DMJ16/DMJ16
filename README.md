## 👷 Work
Currently looking for a role as a front-end, full-stack, back-end, and/or smart contract developer. I am most experienced with JavaScript/TypeScript using React and Node.js. I studied web development and computer science at Hack Reactor ('20) and I studied finance at Emory University ('16).

## 🔬 Projects
[🚀 ⚛️ 👾 as-game-of-life](https://github.com/DMJ16/as-game-of-life) is a reworking of Conway's Game of Life in AssemblyScript (strict variant of TypeScript to WebAssembly compiler) and rendered in the browser using React, TypeScript, and the use-as-bind hook to interface with the compiled AssemblyScript.

[🔮 graphqlAPI](https://github.com/DMJ16/graphqlAPI) is an API for interfacing with an eCommerce website’s product reviews. [🎮 GraphQL Playground 🎮](http://ec2-34-204-6-123.compute-1.amazonaws.com:4000/reviews)

[🔏 erc1155](https://github.com/DMJ16/erc1155) is a factory contract for generating new ERC1155 contracts. The factory allows developers with knowledge of a number of languages to spawn a new smart contract for tokenzing assets without learning Solidity (Ethereum's smart contract language).

[💡 ts-algo](https://github.com/DMJ16/ts-algo) holds general algorithms, data structures, and CS practice in TypeScript.

[🚀 as-algo](https://github.com/DMJ16/as-algo) holds general algorithms, data structures, and practice WASI implementations in AssemblyScript.

[🦀 rs-algo](https://github.com/DMJ16/rs-algo) holds general algorithms and data structures in Rust.
