## 👷 Work
Currently looking for a role as a front-end, full-stack, back-end, and/or smart contract developer. I am most experienced with JavaScript/TypeScript using React and Node.js. I studied web development and computer science at Hack Reactor ('20) and I studied finance at Emory University ('16).

## 🔬 Projects
[🔏 erc1155](https://github.com/DMJ16/erc1155) is a factory contract for generating new ERC1155 contracts. The factory allows developers with knowledge of a number of languages to spawn a new smart contract for tokenzing assets without learning Solidity (Ethereum's smart contract language).

[🚀 ⚛️ 👾 as-game-of-life](https://github.com/DMJ16/as-game-of-life) is a reworking of Conway's Game of Life in AssemblyScript (strict variant of TypeScript to WebAssembly compiler) and rendered in the browser using React, TypeScript, and the use-as-bind hook to interface with the compiled AssemblyScript.
