# David Josephs
## 👷 Work
Currently looking for a frontend or fullstack developer role, but am most interested in web3 and smart contract development. While I have more experience with JavaScript/TypeScript using React and Node.js, I have significant experience with Ethereum smart contract development using Solidity, Hardhat, and the ethers.js and web3.js convenience libraries. I studied web development and computer science at Hack Reactor ('20) and I studied finance at Emory University ('16).
