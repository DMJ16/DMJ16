## 👷 Work
Currently looking for a frontend, fullstack, or smart contract developer role. I primarily use JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Node.js. However, I also have experience writing smart contracts in Solidity using both Truffle and Hardhat, testing the contracts with TypeScript and TypeChain, and interfacing with Ethereum using the web3.js and ethers.js convenience libraries. I am familiar with the ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 token standards. I studied finance at Emory University and I studied web development and computer science at Hack Reactor.
